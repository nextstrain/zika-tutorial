# Nextstrain build template: arbitrary virus

This repository serves as a template for creating a nextstrain build for an arbitrary viral pathogen of interest.

To get started, take a look at config.yml; note that this includes values for all available arguments in the corresponding augur workflow step, including those with reasonable defaults. The parameters which are most important to review before running your workflow are prefaced with tag `## IMPORTANT PARAMETER`.

For a full walkthrough, see the [Zika virus tutorial](https://nextstrain.org/docs/getting-started/zika-tutorial).
